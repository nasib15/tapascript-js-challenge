# Tasks

## 1. Generate a Pyramid Pattern using Nested Loop as it is shown below:

```bash
*
* *
* * *
* * * *
* * * * *
```

## 2. Craete Multiplication Table (Using for loop)

Write a program to print the multiplication table of a given number up to 10.
For Example: If N = 3, output should be:

```bash
3 x 1 = 3
3 x 2 = 6
...
3 x 10 = 30
```

## 3. Find the summation of all odd numbers between 1 to 500 and print them on teh console log.

## 4. Skipping Multiples of 3

Write a program to print numbers from 1 to 20, but skip multiples of 3.

## 5. Reverse Digits of a Number (Using while loop)

Write a program to reverse the digits of a given number using a while loop.

Example:

```bash
Input: 6789
Output: 9876
```

## 6. Write your understanding on the difefrences between for, while, and do-while loop. Create their flow charts.
